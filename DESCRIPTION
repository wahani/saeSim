Description: Tools for the simulation of data in the context of small area
    estimation. Combine all steps of your simulation - from data generation
    over drawing samples to model fitting - in one object. This enables easy
    modification and combination of different scenarios. You can store your
    results in a folder or start the simulation in parallel.
