Version 0.6.4
- Rewrite of the summary method
- New function sim_gen_generic

Version 0.6.3
- Bugfixes in sim_gen for contamination and sim_gen_eq to preserve attributes of data.frame
- The show method was updated and is more consistent
- Bugfix in as.data.frame: will now always return a data.frame

- bugfix: keep attributes after sampling

Version 0.5.0

- R, the number of reps, is not an argument of sim_setup anymore but only of sim
- Generator functions are now functions which f: data.frame -> data.frame
- The response is not generated automatically but using the sim_resp component
- comp_var function is now a wrapper around dplyr::mutate
- sample_number and sample_fraction replace sample_srs and sample_csrs
- agg_standard was renamed to agg_all
- calc was renamed to comp; sim_n, sim_N, sim_popMean, sim_popVar are renamed to sim_comp_*
- Contaminated data is now included in sim_gen_cont; argument names have changed
- The base can explicitly be set by sim_base or simply by starting from a data.frame
- gen_generic supports a groupVar instead of level
