\description{
This is the documentation for the show methods in the package \code{saeSim}. In case you don't know, \code{show } is for S4-classes like \code{print} for S3. If you don't know what that means, don't bother, there is no reason to call \code{show} directly, however there is the need to document it.
}
\details{
Will print the head of a \code{sim_setup} to the console, after converting it to a \code{data.frame}.
